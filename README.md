Sign up for a Twitter Developer account and create a new app. This will give you access to the Twitter API, which you will use to programmatically interact with Twitter.

Install the twit package using npm (Node Package Manager). This is a Node.js library that provides easy-to-use functions for interacting with the Twitter API.

In your JavaScript code, require the twit package and authenticate your app using your Twitter API keys and access tokens.

Use the twit library to send a tweet using the post function. You can include a message in the tweet using a string, and you can also include any other optional parameters such as images or hashtags.
